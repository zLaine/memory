<h2>Recollection</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players travel with the main character, Cassie as a slew of strange occurances both old and new lead her to question herself.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will follow the story as Cassie encounters incresingly odd situations which she has no explanation for.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
An exploration game with a heavy focus on narrative.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player is able to walk around the environment and interact with certain things in it.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Experimentation with more of an in depth narrative and using a lack of information to hook players in.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Provides a unique experience of what will later be discovered to be severe memory loss issues, and what it's like trying to cope with that in the world and keep others from finding out.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting for the game is reality, in a broad sense -- no special world or storyline except Cassie's own life and mind.  
The uniqueness of the world comes from her experiences of trying to navigate the world while living with memory loss.
Full game would take place in both reality and her "In-World" -- the world the others inside her have constructed for them to spend time in.
This part of the game takes place in reality as opposed to her in-world, which the other half focuses on.  They share a narrative but have very different gameplay and focuses.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
In reality strange happenings (misplaced items, gaining awareness in situations/places she has no idea how she got into, finding a phone in her possession and having people mistake her for someone else, etc) culminate in her finding a note left for her on her dresser giving her instructions on how to reach her In-World.  
Not knowing who it is from or how it got there, she follows the instructions hoping to find the answer to the lost time and other problems plagueing her.  This is when she enters the In-World and meets the first of the others living inside her, Jason.
(This is the section of the game that this prototype is NOT showing.)
In her "In-world", the characters she interacts with are distinct people with their own wants and interests and personalities, who have to share her body with her.
As the game would continue she would meet all the people in her system (All the people sharing her body) and continue navigating through her subconcious and the In-World to solve conflicts between members and increase the group's overall effectiveness to allow her to better function in reality.
Each member has their own abilities concerning the In-World, for example, Jason's is the ability to reverse gravity.
Throughout this, if she's in the In-World, someone else has to be controlling her body -- whoever is doing so takes their abilities with them, removing them from her current toolbox.  More than one person can be missing at a time, leading to an interesting combination of abilities that change over time, forcing the player to innovate continue sucessfuly solving the puzzles and making progress.
Outworld: (What this prototype shows)
She will be interacting with both the world and the people around her in unique ways trying to compensate for the memory loss and the other people from her in-world interacting with people while they are in control of the body.
Players will be able to interact with certain objects and trigger events, and eventually make dialogue choices that can influence events as her life progresses in reality.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who enjoys mysterious narratives.  
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
This section, once completed, should take about 5 minutes to complete.  The whole imagined game would ideally take about an hour or two.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Effective strategies will involve exploration of the entire area available.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Characters made using: http://opengameart.org/content/character-rpg-sprites by Curt (cjc83486)
House made using: http://opengameart.org/content/lpc-house-insides
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Didn't use any prototype for guidance save for my own past work.
